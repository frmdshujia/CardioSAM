![SAM 3 architecture](assets/model_diagram.png?raw=true) SAM 3 is a unified foundation model for promptable segmentation in images and videos. It can detect, segment, and track objects using text or visual prompts such as points, boxes, and masks. Compared to its predecessor [SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2), SAM 3 introduces the ability to exhaustively segment all instances of an open-vocabulary concept specified by a short text phrase or exemplars. Unlike prior work, SAM 3 can handle a vastly larger set of open-vocabulary prompts. It achieves 75-80% of human performance on our new [SA-CO benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam3/edit/main_readme/README.md#sa-co-dataset) which contains 270K unique concepts, over 50 times more than existing benchmarks.

This breakthrough is driven by an innovative data engine that has automatically annotated over 4 million unique concepts, creating the largest high-quality open-vocabulary segmentation dataset to date. In addition, SAM 3 introduces a new model architecture featuring a presence token that improves discrimination between closely related text prompts (e.g., “a player in white” vs. “a player in red”), as well as a decoupled detector–tracker design that minimizes task interference and scales efficiently with data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- PyTorch 2.7 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU with CUDA 12.6 or higher

1. **Create a new Conda environment:**

```bash
conda create -n sam3 python=3.12
conda deactivate
conda activate sam3
```

2. **Install PyTorch with CUDA support:**

```bash
pip install torch==2.7.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

3. **Clone the repository and install the package:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam3.git
cd sam3
pip install -e .
```

4. **Install additional dependencies for example notebooks or development:**

```bash
# For running example notebooks
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"

# For development
pip install -e ".[train,dev]"
```

## Getting Started

⚠️ Before using SAM 3, please request access to the checkpoints on the SAM 3
Hugging Face [repo](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3). Once accepted, you
need to be authenticated to download the checkpoints. You can do this by running
the following [steps](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/quick-start#authentication)
(e.g. `hf auth login` after generating an access token.)

### Basic Usage

```python
import torch
#################################### For Image ####################################
from PIL import Image
from sam3.model_builder import build_sam3_image_model
from sam3.model.sam3_image_processor import Sam3Processor
# Load the model
model = build_sam3_image_model()
processor = Sam3Processor(model)
# Load an image
image = Image.open("<YOUR_IMAGE_PATH.jpg>")
inference_state = processor.set_image(image)
# Prompt the model with text
output = processor.set_text_prompt(state=inference_state, prompt="<YOUR_TEXT_PROMPT>")

# Get the masks, bounding boxes, and scores
masks, boxes, scores = output["masks"], output["boxes"], output["scores"]

#################################### For Video ####################################

from sam3.model_builder import build_sam3_video_predictor

video_predictor = build_sam3_video_predictor()
video_path = "<YOUR_VIDEO_PATH>" # a JPEG folder or an MP4 video file
# Start a session
response = video_predictor.handle_request(
    request=dict(
        type="start_session",
        resource_path=video_path,
    )
)
response = video_predictor.handle_request(
    request=dict(
        type="add_prompt",
        session_id=response["session_id"],
        frame_index=0, # Arbitrary frame index
        text="<YOUR_TEXT_PROMPT>",
    )
)
output = response["outputs"]
```

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains notebooks demonstrating how to use SAM3 with
various types of prompts:

- [`sam3_image_predictor_example.ipynb`](examples/sam3_image_predictor_example.ipynb)
  : Demonstrates how to prompt SAM 3 with text and visual box prompts on images.
- [`sam3_video_predictor_example.ipynb`](examples/sam3_video_predictor_example.ipynb)
  : Demonstrates how to prompt SAM 3 with text prompts on videos, and doing
  further interactive refinements with points.
- [`sam3_image_batched_inference.ipynb`](examples/sam3_image_batched_inference.ipynb)
  : Demonstrates how to run batched inference with SAM 3 on images.
- [`sam3_agent.ipynb`](examples/sam3_agent.ipynb): Demonsterates the use of SAM
  3 Agent to segment complex text prompt on images.
- [`saco_gold_silver_vis_example.ipynb`](examples/saco_gold_silver_vis_example.ipynb)
  : Shows a few examples from SA-Co image evaluation set.
- [`saco_veval_vis_example.ipynb`](examples/saco_veval_vis_example.ipynb) :
  Shows a few examples from SA-Co video evaluation set.

There are additional notebooks in the examples directory that demonstrate how to
use SAM 3 for interactive instance segmentation in images and videos (SAM 1/2
tasks), or as a tool for an MLLM, and how to run evaluations on the SA-Co
dataset.

To run the Jupyter notebook examples:

```bash
# Make sure you have the notebooks dependencies installed
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"

# Start Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook examples/sam3_image_predictor_example.ipynb
```

## Model

SAM 3 consists of a detector and a tracker that share a vision encoder. It has 848M parameters. The
detector is a DETR-based model conditioned on text, geometry, and image
exemplars. The tracker inherits the SAM 2 transformer encoder-decoder
architecture, supporting video segmentation and interactive refinement.

## SA-Co Dataset

We release 2 image benchmarks, [SA-Co/Gold](scripts/eval/gold/README.md) and
[SA-Co/Silver](scripts/eval/silver/README.md), and a video benchmark
[SA-Co/VEval](scripts/eval/veval/README.md). The datasets contain images (or videos) with annotated noun phrases. Each image/video and noun phrase pair is annotated with instance masks and unique IDs of each object matching the phrase. Phrases that have no matching objects (negative prompts) have no masks, shown in red font in the figure. See the linked READMEs for more details on how to download and run evaluations on the datasets.
